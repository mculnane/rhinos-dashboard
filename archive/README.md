## Files:

## Why Archived?

The Excel approach worked well for desktop/laptop users but wasn't suitable for mobile (95% of communication happens on WhatsApp via phones). The project pivoted to a mobile-first HTML dashboard that's optimized for portrait orientation and touch interfaces.

The Excel file served as an excellent prototype and helped establish the data structure and statistics that were then implemented in the web dashboard.

## Historical Value:

This Excel file contains the original match data and was used to extract squad information for matches M01-M04, which was then incorporated into the web dashboard's data.js file.
