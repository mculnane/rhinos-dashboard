ASPLEY GUISE RHINOS U8s - QUICK DATA ENTRY GUIDE
================================================================================

You now have TWO ways to add new match data to your spreadsheet:

================================================================================
OPTION 1: MANUAL ENTRY (Simple, no scripting)
================================================================================

1. Open the spreadsheet and go to the "Data Entry" sheet (first tab)

2. Fill in the YELLOW cells:
   - Section 1: Match details (date, opponent, scores, etc.)
   - Section 2: Goals scored (one row per goal)
   - Section 3: Playing squad (enter 1 for played, 0 for didn't play)

3. Copy the data to the appropriate sheets:
   - Match details → Add new row to "Matches" sheet
   - Goals → Add new rows to "Goals" sheet
   - Appearances → Add new column to "Appearances" sheet (or update existing)

4. Clear the Data Entry form and you're ready for the next match!

The Dashboard will automatically update with the new statistics.

================================================================================
OPTION 2: AUTOMATED SCRIPT (Faster, more convenient)
================================================================================

1. Fill in the "Data Entry" sheet as described above

2. Run the Python script:
   - Open Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Navigate to the folder containing the spreadsheet
   - Run: python3 add_match_data.py

3. The script will:
   ✓ Read all data from the Data Entry sheet
   ✓ Add it to the correct sheets automatically
   ✓ Validate that required fields are filled
   ✓ Calculate result (W/D/L) automatically
   ✓ Update all formulas
   ✓ Offer to clear the form for next match

4. Check the Dashboard to see updated stats!

TIPS FOR QUICK ENTRY
================================================================================

• Match ID format: M05, M06, M07, etc. (keep sequential)
• Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2026-02-14)
• Use dropdowns for Home/Away and Own Goal (Yes/No)
• Leave Assister blank if goal was unassisted
• Enter 1 or 0 for player appearances (not blank)
• Competition defaults to "League" - change if needed
